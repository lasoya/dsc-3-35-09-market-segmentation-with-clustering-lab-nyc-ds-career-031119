    "The highest ARS should be ~0.23, which suggests that the clusters are better than random chance, but far from perfect.  Overall, the quality of the clustering algorithm did alot better than the first algorithm we ran on unscaled data. The best performance was achieved when reducing the number of Principal Components down to 4. The increase in model performance is likely due to the reduction in dimensionality. Although dropping the last 2 PCs means that we lose about 6% of our explained variance, this proved to be a net-positive tradeoff for the reduction in dimensionality it provided. "

    "The highest adjusted rand score achieved was 0.09419, which is still far from being great but is better than when the number of components was not stated explicitly in the PCA object. In addition, when using PCA with k-means clustering, the quality of the clustering is better than without PCA as shown by the adjusted rand score. The minimum principal components that was allowed was 6 - from the graph of the cumulative explained variance as the number of components increases, 6 seems to be the best number to use for best overall clustering performance. This is probably because it is the point at which there is the right balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting)."
